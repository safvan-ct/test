                                        <p>You can check your trust factor by queuing up in a lobby of cs go ranked accounts. Your trust factor will only be displayed to your lobby members if it is yellow or red. If it is yellow or red then it will affect your matchmaking experience.Trust factor can be improved by adding your phone number to your steam account and having a prime status upgrade. If you haven’t added your mobile number yet, then we recommend you to add it. By doing this you can increase your matchmaking experience. If you are a positive member of the steam community and your profile is clean then too you will have a good trust factor. If you think you are having a bad matchmaking experience due to your trust factor, you can contact steam support. Here is the mail address: CSGOTeamFeedback@valvesoftware.com. If you don’t want to do this you can directly buy a high trust factor account from us</p>
